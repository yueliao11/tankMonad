# Round System Implementation Complete ✅

## 🎯 Enhancement #1: Complete Round System

### ✅ Implemented Features

#### 1. **Configurable Round Duration**
- `ROUND_SECONDS: 180` (3 minutes) in `gameConfig.ts`
- Easily configurable for different game modes
- Automatic conversion to milliseconds for internal use

#### 2. **Game State Management**
- **WAITING**: Game waiting for players to join
- **PLAYING**: Active round in progress
- **FINISHED**: Round ended, inputs locked
- **RESULTS**: Displaying final results and champion

#### 3. **Countdown Timer System**
- Precise round timing using `roundStartTime` and `roundDuration`
- Real-time countdown with `getRoundTimeRemaining()`
- Automatic round end when time expires

#### 4. **State Locking & Champion Crowning**
- **Input Locking**: All player inputs disabled when round ends
- **Champion System**: Highest scoring player crowned champion
- **Leaderboard Freezing**: Final rankings locked at round end

#### 5. **Auto-Start Mechanism**
- Automatic round start when first player joins (3-second delay)
- Seamless transition between rounds
- 10-second results display period

### 🔧 Technical Implementation

#### **TankGameModel.ts Updates**
```typescript
// New properties
gameState: string = GAME_STATES.WAITING
roundStartTime: number = 0
roundDuration: number = GAME_CONFIG.ROUND_SECONDS * 1000
champion: string = ''
finalLeaderboard: any[] = []

// New methods
startWaitingPhase() // Initialize waiting state
checkAutoStart() // Auto-start when players join
startRound() // Begin new round
endRound() // Lock state and crown champion
showResults() // Display results phase
clearAllEntities() // Reset monsters and bullets
```

#### **TankModel.ts Updates**
```typescript
// New properties
kills: number = 0
inputsLocked: boolean = false

// New methods
resetForNewRound() // Reset all stats for new round
lockInputs() // Disable all player inputs
recordKill() // Track kills and award +100 points
```

#### **Enhanced Combat System**
- **-10HP bullet damage** (reduced from 25HP)
- **+100 points for player kills** (PvP combat)
- **+50 points for monster kills** (PvE combat)
- Kill tracking with `recordKill()` method

#### **Unified 20 FPS Game Loop**
```typescript
unifiedGameLoop() {
  // Update entities only during PLAYING state
  if (this.gameState === GAME_STATES.PLAYING) {
    this.updateEntities()
    this.checkCollisions()
    this.checkRoundEndConditions()
  }
  
  this.publishStateUpdate()
  this.future(NETWORK.TICK_MS).unifiedGameLoop() // 50ms = 20 FPS
}
```

### 📊 Enhanced State Publishing

The game now publishes comprehensive state updates including:
```typescript
{
  gameState: 'waiting|playing|finished|results',
  roundTimeRemaining: number, // Milliseconds left
  champion: string, // Winner's address
  leaderboard: Array<{
    address: string,
    score: number,
    isAlive: boolean,
    kills: number
  }>
}
```

### 🎮 Game Flow

1. **WAITING** → Players join → Auto-start after 3s
2. **PLAYING** → 3-minute round → Countdown to 0
3. **FINISHED** → Inputs locked → Champion crowned
4. **RESULTS** → Show winner for 10s → Back to WAITING

### 🏆 Champion System

- **Automatic**: Highest score when round ends
- **Crown Event**: Published to all players
- **Persistent**: Champion shown during results phase
- **Reset**: New champion each round

### ⚡ Performance Optimizations

- **Unified 20 FPS tick** for all entity updates
- **State-based entity updates** (only during PLAYING)
- **Efficient collision detection** with early exits
- **Optimized state publishing** every tick

### 🔄 Backward Compatibility

All legacy properties maintained:
- `isActive` boolean (mapped to playing state)
- `startTime` and `duration` (legacy timing)
- `getGameState()` returns enhanced state with legacy fields
